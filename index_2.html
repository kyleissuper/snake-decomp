<h1>Snake Decomp</h1>
<p>First, I need to think about milestones. Here's a tentative list.</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a box for the game to take place.</li>
<li>Make a dot that moves in a single direction across the screen.</li>
<li>Make the next move for the dot controllable with arrow keys.</li>
<li>Add a random apple generator.</li>
<li>Add collision detection (with wall, apple, and self).</li>
<li>Allow snake to lengthen.</li>
<li>Any miscellaneous stuff comes at the end (make it pretty, add a score counter, and so on).</li>
</ol>
